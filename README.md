# ArchlinuxVim
Archlinux distro for VIM Platform of Khadas compile.

I took Kernel from Ubutu for VIM3 SBC of KHADAS repository https://dl.khadas.com/Firmware/VIM3/Ubuntu/SD_USB/VIM3_Ubuntu-gnome-focal_Linux-5.12_arm64_SD-USB_V1.0.5-210430.img.xz
I took Archlinux core Filesystem for ODROID-N2 Friendly ARM device  http://os.archlinuxarm.org/os/ArchLinuxARM-odroid-n2-latest.tar.gz 
And I have to connect Ubuntu kernel images and Archlinux and this is working.

Now I try to compile own Kernel image from sources but while my effort failure :) 
Last time when I had compile process of kernel sources  it was 2.6 version and since many varied))
